F# Depth Colorizer
====================

Since [F# Depth Colorizer](http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/f-depth-colorizer-for-vs2012-now-available/ "F# Depth Colorizer for VS2012 now available") in [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07636c36-52be-4dce-9f2e-3c56b8329e33 "F# Depth Colorizer for VS2012") does not support VS2013 as of 11/18/2013. I modified the original repo and make it supports VS2013. If you don't want to compile it, you can just download the VSIX installer [here](http://sdrv.ms/17iOe8r).

The extension doesn't work with Dark theme out-of-the-box, but you can also download the file, dark-FSharpDepthColorizer.reg, and run it.
